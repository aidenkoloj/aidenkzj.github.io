        <h2>Miscellaneous Reflections on Welding</h2>
        <p>
            One rule for our hotworks space is that if you're welding you need to yell out "Welding!" before you weld to alert others in the space. Whenever I lead the trainings I have people practice yelling "Welding!" before we weld. It never ceases to be a funny, somewhat awkward moment; at first people are often sheepish and shy and I have to press them, saying, "No, really I need you to yell: WELDING!, not just whisper it, let's try again!" I suppose in that way I'm sort of leading a drama class or warm-up for a choir.

            It's a fun reversal of what I think most people are often told when they're younger: to keep a respectful, indoor voice. How often do you engage in an activity where someone's telling you, in fact demanding (albeit for safety reasons), that you yell? In fact, yelling "welding" reflects what welding is all about; it's not a quiet, reserved activity—you've got hunks of red hot steel, flying sparks, and the sizzling of the welder.
        </p>
        <p>
            And I think all of that makes it a really unique and fun means of self-expression; welding can be quite cathartic.
